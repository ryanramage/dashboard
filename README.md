## The Garden Project

Part of an open Garden, opposite of a [Walled Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(technology\) ), is a place for couchapp developers to distribute couchapps.
The name also pays tribute to the [Garden](https://couchapp.org/page/garden) project by J Chris Anderson.

# The Garden Dashboard

A dashboard is what the user will have installed in their hosted space. It will list all their installed couchapps, and it will receive install requests from the garden (initiated by the user).
